## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Kotlin  
- **Framework:** Android (Material Design components)  
- **Data Storage:** In-memory (via singleton `AppData` object).  
  - `AppData` keeps track of income, EMI, and expense list globally.  
  - `Expense` class converts daily/recurring to monthly equivalents.

## 🌱 Future Improvements

- Persist data locally using Room or SharedPreferences so values remain after closing the app.  
- Use RecyclerView instead of LinearLayout for displaying expenses (more efficient for long lists).  
- Improve expense “bubble” design using Material CardView or Chips.  
- Add categories and filtering for expenses (e.g., Food, Rent, Utilities).  
- Provide graphs or charts (e.g., Pie chart for expenses, line chart for monthly savings trends).  
- Add currency formatting and localization support.  
- Optional: Dark mode theme toggle.
